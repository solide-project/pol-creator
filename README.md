## About POL

Built on the Open Campus protocol, POL enables users to learn by directly interacting with smart contracts and blockchain ecosystems. A standout feature is the issuance of POL POAPs (Proof of Achievement Protocol) as non-transferable NFTs, which serve as verifiable credentials for completed learning tasks. POL is designed to support a wide range of blockchains, including EVM-based, Move, and Stylus, making it a flexible and comprehensive learning hub for the entire Web3 space.
